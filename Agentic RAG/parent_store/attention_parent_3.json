  "page_content": "## **3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention**  \nInstead of performing a single attention function with _d_ model-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values _h_ times with different, learned linear projections to _dk_ , _dk_ and _dv_ dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding _dv_ -dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.  \nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.  \n> 4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of _q_ and _k_ are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, _q · k_ =[�] _[d][k][[q][i][k][i]][[i][k][i]][[k][i]][[i]]_[[, has mean][ 0][ and variance]][[ 0][ and variance]][[ and variance]] _[[ d][k]][[k]]_[[.]]  \n_i_ =1 _[[k]][[q][i][k][i]][[i][k][i]][[k][i]][[i]]_[[, has mean][ 0][ and variance]][[ 0][ and variance]][[ and variance]] _[[ d][k]][[k]]_[[.]]  \n--- end of page.page_number=4 ---  \nMultiHead( _Q, K, V_ ) = Concat(head1 _, ...,_ headh) _W[O]_  \nwhere headi = Attention( _QWi[Q][, KW][ K] i[, V W][ V] i_[)]  \nWhere the projections are parameter matrices _Wi[Q] ∈_ R _[d]_[model] _[×][d][k]_ , _Wi[K] ∈_ R _[d]_[model] _[×][d][k]_ , _Wi[V] ∈_ R _[d]_[model] _[×][d][v]_ and _W[O] ∈_ R _[hd][v][×][d]_[model] .  \nIn this work we employ _h_ = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use _dk_ = _dv_ = _d_ model _/h_ = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n## **3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model**  \nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:  \n- In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [31, 2, 8].  \n- The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.  \n- Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to _−∞_ ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.",
