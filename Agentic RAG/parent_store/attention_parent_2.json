We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( _x_ + Sublayer( _x_ )), where Sublayer( _x_ ) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension _d_ model = 512.  \n**Decoder:** The decoder is also composed of a stack of _N_ = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position _i_ can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than _i_ .\n\n## **3.2 Attention**  \nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n## **3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention**  \nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension _dk_ , and values of dimension _dv_ .

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices _K_ and _V_ . We compute the matrix of outputs as:  \n**==> picture [286 x 27] intentionally omitted <==**  \nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1 ~~_√_~~ _dk_[. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with] a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.  \nWhile for small values of _dk_ the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of _dk_ [3]. We suspect that for large values of _dk_ , the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients[4] . To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by ~~_√_~~ 1 _dk_[.]",
